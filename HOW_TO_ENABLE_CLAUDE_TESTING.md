# How to Enable Claude (in Cursor) to Test Notebooks on Google Colab A100

## Overview
Claude in Cursor has access to **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** including the **Playwright browser automation** tool. This allows Claude to:
1. Open Google Colab in a browser
2. Upload and run notebooks
3. Monitor execution and capture errors
4. Take screenshots of results
5. Debug issues in real-time

## Prerequisites

### 1. Google Colab Setup
- You need a Google account with Colab access
- **Recommended**: Google Colab Pro or Pro+ for A100 access
- **Free tier**: Limited to T4 GPU, may run out of memory on larger models

### 2. MCP Playwright Server
Cursor should have the Playwright MCP server enabled. Check if you see these tools available:
- `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate`
- `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot`
- `mcp_playwright_browser_click`
- `mcp_playwright_browser_type`

## How to Enable Claude to Test

### Option 1: Direct Browser Automation (Recommended)

**Step 1: Ask Claude to test a specific lab**
```
"Can you open Google Colab, upload Lab 5, and run it to check for errors?"
```

**Step 2: Claude will:**
1. Navigate to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload the notebook from the local filesystem
3. Change runtime to GPU (A100 if available)
4. Run all cells sequentially
5. Monitor for errors and capture screenshots
6. Report back with results

**Step 3: Claude can debug issues**
If errors occur, Claude can:
- Read the error messages from the browser
- Modify the notebook locally
- Re-upload and test again
- Iterate until it works

### Option 2: Manual Upload + Claude Monitoring

**Step 1: You upload the notebook to Colab**
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload the notebook manually
3. Share the Colab URL with Claude

**Step 2: Ask Claude to monitor**
```
"Here's my Colab notebook: [URL]. Can you monitor it and help debug any errors?"
```

**Step 3: Claude will:**
1. Navigate to the URL
2. Take snapshots of the notebook state
3. Read error messages
4. Suggest fixes
5. You apply fixes and re-run

### Option 3: Automated Testing Script

**Step 1: Ask Claude to create a test script**
```
"Can you create a Python script that uploads and tests all labs on Colab using the Colab API?"
```

**Step 2: Claude will create:**
- A script using `google-colab` API or Selenium
- Automated upload and execution
- Error capture and reporting
- Screenshot generation

## What Claude Can Do

### ✅ Claude CAN:
- Navigate to Google Colab in a browser
- Upload notebooks from local filesystem
- Click buttons (Runtime → Run all, Change runtime type)
- Read error messages from the browser
- Take screenshots of execution
- Monitor cell execution status
- Capture output and logs
- Debug and fix issues iteratively

### ❌ Claude CANNOT (without your help):
- Authenticate to your Google account (you need to be logged in)
- Access Colab Pro features unless you're already subscribed
- Run notebooks faster than Colab's execution speed
- Bypass Colab's resource limits

## Typical Testing Workflow

### For a Single Lab:
```
You: "Test Lab 5 on Colab with A100"

Claude will:
1. Navigate to colab.research.google.com
2. Upload solution_notebooks/Lab5_Distillation_Unsloth_SQuAD.ipynb
3. Click Runtime → Change runtime type → A100 GPU
4. Click Runtime → Run all
5. Monitor execution (takes 10-30 minutes)
6. Capture any errors
7. Report results with screenshots
```

### For All Labs:
```
You: "Test all Unsloth labs (4-7) on Colab and report which ones have errors"

Claude will:
1. Test each lab sequentially
2. Create a summary report
3. Highlight errors and suggest fixes
4. Optionally fix and re-test
```

## Example Commands to Try

### Basic Testing:
```
"Open Lab 5 in Google Colab and run the first 3 cells to check if installation works"
```

### Full Testing:
```
"Run Lab 5 completely on Colab A100 and let me know if there are any errors"
```

### Debugging:
```
"Lab 5 is giving an EmptyLogits error. Can you open it in Colab, reproduce the error, and fix it?"
```

### Batch Testing:
```
"Test Labs 4, 5, 6, and 7 on Colab. For each one, report:
- Does installation work?
- Does training complete?
- Are there any errors?
- What's the final output?"
```

## Important Notes

### 1. Authentication
- You must be logged into Google Colab in your browser
- Claude can use your existing session
- If session expires, you'll need to re-authenticate

### 2. Runtime Selection
- Free tier: T4 GPU (may run out of memory)
- Colab Pro: T4, V100, or A100
- Claude can select the runtime, but you need the subscription

### 3. Execution Time
- Labs take 10-30 minutes to run
- Claude can monitor in the background
- You can ask for periodic updates

### 4. Resource Limits
- Colab has usage limits (compute units)
- Free tier: ~12 hours/day
- Pro: Higher limits but still capped

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude can't access Colab"
**Solution**: Make sure Playwright MCP server is enabled in Cursor settings

### "Claude can't upload files"
**Solution**: Ensure the notebook files are in the workspace and accessible

### "Claude can't see errors"
**Solution**: Ask Claude to take screenshots or read the browser content

### "Execution takes too long"
**Solution**: Ask Claude to check periodically rather than wait for completion

## Best Practices

1. **Test one lab at a time** - Easier to debug
2. **Start with installation cells** - Catch dependency issues early
3. **Use screenshots** - Visual confirmation of success/failure
4. **Iterate quickly** - Fix errors and re-test immediately
5. **Save working versions** - Commit successful runs to git

## Next Steps

Once you're ready to test, just say:
```
"Claude, test Lab 5 on Google Colab with A100 GPU and report any errors"
```

Claude will handle the rest!

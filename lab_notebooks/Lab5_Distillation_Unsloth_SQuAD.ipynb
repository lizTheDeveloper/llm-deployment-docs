    "# Lab 5 – Distilling a Pre-Trained LLM with Unsloth (SQuAD)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This lab requires **Google Colab with GPU enabled**\n",
    "> - Go to Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4 or better)\n",
    "> - Unsloth requires CUDA and will not work on Mac/Windows locally\n",
    "> - See `COLAB_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will perform **model distillation** using Unsloth. Distillation allows you to compress a large \"teacher\" model into a smaller \"student\" model while retaining much of the original model's performance. We'll use the SQuAD dataset for a question-answering task to illustrate this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Distillation? The Knowledge Transfer Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "- 🏫 **Large Models**: GPT-4, LLaMA-70B, Claude-3 are incredibly powerful but HUGE\n",
    "- 💰 **Deployment Costs**: Large models = expensive inference, high memory requirements\n",
    "- 📱 **Edge Deployment**: Can't run 70B models on phones, edge devices, or in real-time\n",
    "- ⚡ **Speed Requirements**: Production systems need fast, responsive models\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution - Knowledge Distillation:**\n",
    "- 🎓 **Teacher Model**: Large, powerful model (e.g., 7B parameters)\n",
    "- 🎓 **Student Model**: Smaller, faster model (e.g., 1B parameters)\n",
    "- 🧠 **Knowledge Transfer**: Student learns from teacher's \"soft\" predictions\n",
    "- ⚖️ **Trade-off**: Slight accuracy loss for massive speed/memory gains\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "- 📱 **Mobile Apps**: ChatGPT on your phone uses distilled models\n",
    "- 🚗 **Autonomous Vehicles**: Real-time decision making requires fast models\n",
    "- 💬 **Customer Service**: Chatbots need to respond quickly\n",
    "- 🔍 **Search Engines**: Instant results require optimized models\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Distillation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Teacher Knowledge**\n",
    "- Large model makes predictions with \"soft\" probabilities\n",
    "- Example: [0.7, 0.2, 0.1] instead of [1, 0, 0] (hard labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Student Learning**\n",
    "- Small model learns to mimic teacher's soft predictions\n",
    "- Uses temperature scaling to make learning easier\n",
    "- Combines teacher knowledge with ground truth labels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Deployment**\n",
    "- Student model is much smaller and faster\n",
    "- Retains most of teacher's knowledge\n",
    "- Perfect for production deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the distillation process** and why it's valuable\n",
    "- **Evaluate baseline performance** of teacher and student models\n",
    "- Load a pre-trained teacher model and prepare a smaller student model\n",
    "- Load and preprocess the SQuAD dataset for question answering\n",
    "- **Implement knowledge distillation** with proper temperature scaling\n",
    "- Fine-tune the student model with LoRA/QLoRA adapters using Unsloth\n",
    "- **Compare performance** after distillation (accuracy vs speed trade-offs)\n",
    "- Evaluate and compare the teacher and student models on accuracy and inference speed\n",
    "- **Analyze the trade-offs**: How much knowledge is transferred vs lost?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Distillation requires significant compute resources. Use Google Colab Pro for faster training, or reduce the dataset size if using free tier."
